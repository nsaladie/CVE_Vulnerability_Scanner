# CVE Vulnerability Checker
This project provides a Python script to check if a specific version of software (such as SSH, Bind, MariaDB) on Ubuntu is vulnerable to a specific CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

## Project Overview
The script takes a CVE ID, a version of the software, and a release version of Ubuntu, and checks if that version is vulnerable to the specified CVE. It uses the Ubuntu API to obtain CVE details and performs various checks and transformations on the version to determine vulnerability.

## Features
 - CVE-based vulnerability checking.
 - Handling of multiple version formats.
 - Version comparison using GPT-4 model to generate structured JSON responses.

## Requirements
 - Python 3.12
 - Libraries:
    - gpt4all
    - requests
    - argparse
    - json
    - re

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cve-vulnerability-checker.git
cd cve-vulnerability-checker
```
2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command:
```
python script.py <cve_id> "version" [release]
```
 - <cve_id>: The CVE ID (e.g., CVE-2022-12345).
 - "version": The version of the software (e.g., 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.10).
 - [release]: The Ubuntu release version (e.g., focal).
